It will be electronic menu which will used instead of paper menus. ***  #### The main idea of electronic menu is there is no waitress who will accept the order.  #### There will a list of snacks, dishes, culinary products, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages  #### and other products that are on sale. Each category of foods will in different pages. Each  #### item(food, drink) will clickable and will contain photo, description, price, weight. When  #### client will click it, it will move to the order sheet of client. At the end of order sheet will total  #### bill(total money) of order, people can see bill before accepting order. In our mind it is  #### important and convenient. At the end, client will click \"To order\" button, after order sheet  #### will sent to the chefs in kitchen or manager. Chefs will cook food looking electronic order  #### sheet on the TV or computer which will located in the kitchen. Waitress will only bring food  #### or drink to the client in the hall.  *** #### \tIf we come up with new ideas, we will add some functionalities.",
